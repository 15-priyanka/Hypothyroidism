<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Hypothyroidism</h1>
<h3><marquee>Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">
<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p>The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fatigue</li><li>
Increased sensitivity to cold</li><li>
Constipation</li><li>
Dry skin</li><li>
Weight gain</li><li>
Puffy face</li><li>
Hoarseness</li><li>
Muscle weakness</li><li>
Elevated blood cholesterol level</li><li>
Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness</li><li>
Pain, stiffness or swelling in your joints</li><li>
Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods</li><li>
Thinning hair</li><li>
Slowed heart rate</li><li>
Depression</li><li>
Impaired memory</li><li>
Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter)</li></ul>

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones, the balance of chemical reactions in your body can be upset. There can be a number of causes, including autoimmune disease, hyperthyroidism treatments, radiation therapy, thyroid surgery and certain medications.</li><li>

Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism. These hormones also influence the control of vital functions, such as body temperature and heart rate.</li><li>

Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough hormones.</li></ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<ul>
	<li>People with symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry, flaky skin may have hypothyroidism. A blood test can confirm the diagnosis.</li><li>
"Secondary" or "tertiary" hypothyroidism occurs when the decrease in thyroid hormone is due to a defect of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. A special test, known as the TRH test, can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. This test requires an injection of the TRH hormone and is performed by a doctor that treats thyroid conditions (endocrinologist or hormone specialist).</li><li>
Blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but does not identify the cause. A combination of the patient's clinical history, antibody screening, and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the underlying thyroid problem more clearly.</li><li>
An MRI of the brain and other tests may be ordered if the cause is thought to be from pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Hypothyroidism can be easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement. The preferred treatment for most people with an underactive thyroid is levothyroxine sodium (Levoxyl, Synthroid). This is a more stable form of thyroid hormone and requires once a day dosing.Liothyronine sodium (Cytomel) also may be prescribed to treat hypothyroidism under certain conditions.</li><li>

With the exception of certain conditions, the treatment of hypothyroidism requires life-long therapy. However, over treating hypothyroidism with excessive thyroid medication is potentially harmful and can cause problems with heart palpitations and blood pressure control, and contribute to osteoporosis.</li>
</ul>
